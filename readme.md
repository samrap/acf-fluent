**Are you using ACF Fluent?**

ACF Fluent is almost at 8000 downloads, which I think is pretty cool! I mean, it's not _a ton_ of downloads, but cool nonetheless. If you're using it, I would love to hear your feedback. [Shoot me an email](mailto:me@samrapdev.com) and let me know what kind of projects you've used it on :). While I'm not working on it actively at this time, I'm still happy to maintain it.

### What is ACF Fluent?

ACF Fluent is a [fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) for the Advanced Custom Fields WordPress plugin. It enables theme developers to create custom field "queries" using an expressive, fluent interface that makes templating with ACF a breeze.

### Why?

If you make heavy use of Advanced Custom Fields in your WordPress templates (you should), then you probably find yourself writing a lot of repetitive code just to print out your fields. For example, you might have a `heading` field for your page's hero section:

```php
<?php

$heading = get_field('heading');

if (is_null($heading)) {
    $heading = get_the_title();
} else {
    $heading = esc_html($heading);
}

?>

<h1><?= $heading ?></h1>
```

As you know, this type of template coding will clutter up your template files quickly, turning your well-structured HTML into a mess of PHP tags and blocks. The worst part is, you'll find yourself not only in a clutter of PHP logic, but repeating the same logic over and over!

ACF Fluent aims to minimize the mess with a fluent builder that lets you easily get and update fields and sub fields and add constraints along the way. Let's take a look at the same functionality above, using ACF Fluent:

```php
<?php

use Samrap\Acf\Acf;

$heading = Acf::field('heading')
                ->default(get_the_title())
                ->escape()
                ->get();

?>

<h1><?= $heading ?></h1>

```
